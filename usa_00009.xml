      <txt><![CDATA[SAMPLE identifies the IPUMS sample from which the case is drawn. Each sample receives a unique 6-digit code. The codes are structured as follows:


The first four digits are the year of the census/survey. 



The next two digits identify the sample within the year. 


For most censuses, IPUMS has multiple datasets which were constructed using different sampling techniques (i.e. size/demographic of the sample population, geographic coverage level or location, or duration of the sampling period for the ACS/PRCS samples).  

The availability table for each variable indicates whether that variable is available in only certain samples for a given year. For further discussion of sample differences, see "Sample Designs." [URL omitted from DDI.].

Note: SAMPLE replaces DATANUM. Though the last two digits in SAMPLE do not correlate exactly with the now-deprecated DATANUM, the variable serves the same purpose of assigning a unique id to all cases that belong to the same dataset.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HHWT indicates how many households in the U.S. population are represented by a given household in an IPUMS sample. 

It is generally a good idea to use HHWT when conducting a household-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of HHWT is optional when analyzing one of the "flat" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. HHWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for household-level analyses of any sample other than those.

Users should also be sure to select one person (e.g., PERNUM = 1) to represent the entire household.

For further explanation of the sample weights, see "Sample Designs" [URL omitted from DDI.] and "Sample Weights" [URL omitted from DDI.]. See also PERWT for a corresponding variable at the person level, and SLWT for a weight variable used with sample-line records in 1940 1% and 1950.]]></txt>
      <codInstr><![CDATA[
HHWT is a 6-digit numeric variable which indicates how many households in the U.S. population are represented by a given household in an IPUMS sample and has two implied decimals. For example, a HHWT value of 010461 should be interpreted as 104.61. HHWT specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below if applicable by Census year (and data sample if specified).

User Note: Users should also be sure to select one person (e.g., PERNUM = 1) to represent the entire household when using HHWT.

      <labl>Group quarters status</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[GQ classifies all housing units as falling into one of three main categories: households, group quarters, or vacant units. It also identifies fragmentary sample units for 1850-1930 (see below). In all years, the data available about a person and their co-residents depend on whether the person lives in a household or in group quarters. Households are sampled as units, meaning that everyone in the household is included in the sample, and most household-level variables are available. People living in group quarters are generally sampled as individuals; other people in their unit may or may not be included in the sample, and there is no way of linking co-residents' records to one another. If, however, a sampled person in group quarters was living with relatives, the related group was sampled for 1850-1930. Most household-level variables are not available for group quarters or for vacant units.

Group quarters are largely institutions and other group living arrangements, such as rooming houses and military barracks. The definitions vary from year to year, but the pre-1940 samples have generally used a definition of group quarters that includes units with 10 or more individuals unrelated to the householder. See the comparability discussion below and "Sample Designs" [URL omitted from DDI.] for more details about changing definitions of group quarters.  Group-quarters types are identified in further detail by GQTYPE and GQFUNDS.]]></txt>

      <labl>Annual water cost</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[COSTWATR for 1970 reports each rented housing unit's annual water cost, excluding amounts included with contract rent payments. For later years, COSTWATR reports the rented or owned housing unit's annual water cost, again excluding amounts included in contract rent or other types of payments.  In 1970 and 1980, the categories "included in rent" and "no charge" are combined, while they are distinguished in the 1990-2000 censuses and the ACS/PRCS.

COSTWATR amounts for renters are part of RENTGRS. Census Bureau research comparing respondents' reported costs with utility company records indicates that respondents tend to overstate their costs. 

In 1970, the universe for the U.S. Census samples specifies renter-occupied units rented for cash rent, not one-family houses on 10+ acres and not group quarters; however in the Puerto Rican census of 1970, this specification is for renter-occupied units rented for cash rent, not one-family houses on 3+ cuerdas, and not group quarters.

Amounts are expressed in contemporary dollars, and users studying change over time must adjust for inflation. See INCTOT for Consumer Price Index adjustment factors. The exception is the ACS/PRCS multi-year files, where all dollar amounts have been standardized to dollars as valued in the final year of data included in the file (e.g., 2007 dollars for the 2005-2007 3-year file). Additionally, more detail may be available than exists in the original ACS samples.

User Note: ACS respondents are surveyed throughout the year, and amounts do not reflect calendar year dollars. While the Census Bureau provides an adjustment factor (available in ADJUST), this is an imperfect solution. See the ACS income variables note [URL omitted from DDI.] for further details.

User Note
The traditional unit of land area in Puerto Rico is the cuerda.  The cuerda is equal to about 3930 square meters, 4700 square yards, or 0.971 acres.  Because the cuerda and the acre are so close to being equal, they are often treated informally as being equal.  Mainlanders sometimes call the unit the "Spanish Acre."  The IPUMS has preserved the units for the mainland U.S. as acres and Puerto Rico as cuerdas.]]></txt>

COSTWATR is a 4-digit numeric code which reports each rented housing unit's annual water cost, excluding amounts included with contract rent payments for 1970 samples and reports the rented or owned housing unit's annual water cost, again excluding amounts included in contract rent or other types of payments in subsequent Census samples. COSTWATR amounts for renters are included in RENTGRS. Census Bureau research comparing respondents' reported costs with utility company records indicates that respondents tend to overstate their costs. COSTWATR specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below by Census year (and data sample if specified).

      <txt><![CDATA[FOODSTMP indicates whether anyone in the household received Food Stamps (now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP) at any time in the past 12 months. The Food Stamp Act of 1977 was enacted to increase the food purchasing power of eligible households through the use of coupons to purchase food. The Food and Nutrition Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers the Food Stamp Program/SNAP through state and local welfare offices. The Food Stamp Program/SNAP is the major national income support program which provides benefits to all low-income and low-resource households, regardless of the person's characteristics (e.g., sex, age, disability, etc.).  Although all of the ACS questionnaires 2007 and before asked respondents to report the total value of Food Stamps received in the past 12 months, this information is made publicly available only in the ACS and PRCS variable FDSTPAMT, which is available only from 2005-2007.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[PERWT indicates how many persons in the U.S. population are represented by a given person in an IPUMS sample. 

It is generally a good idea to use PERWT when conducting a person-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of PERWT is optional when analyzing one of the "flat" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. PERWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for person-level analyses of any sample other than those.

For further explanation of the sample weights, see "Sample Designs" [URL omitted from DDI.] and "Sample Weights" [URL omitted from DDI.]. See also HHWT for a corresponding variable at the household level, and SLWT for a weight variable used with sample-line records in 1940 and 1950.]]></txt>

PERWT is a 6-digit numeric variable which indicates how many persons in the U.S. population are represented by a given person in an IPUMS sample and has two implied decimals. For example, a PERWT value of 010461 should be interpreted as 104.61.
